## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- A Last FM API account

You can find the latest version of Python 3 at [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), download the correct version for your system and install it.
In order to get a Last FM API account you need to go to [this link](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and follow the instructions. Once you've done that, make a note of your API key, as you'll need it to use the program.

### Installing
```
pip install git+git://github.com/ramadan8/FMSquared.git
```
Or, clone the latest version to a folder and install it using `setup.py`, like below.
```
py setup.py install
```

## Usage
```
fmsquared <token> <user>
```
This is the base command you will have to use any time you run the program. Additional options are available below.
